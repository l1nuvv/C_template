# My First C Project

### How to build the project:
1. Install [MinGW](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/C_template.git
   ```
3. Open the project folder in IDE.
4. Click **Build → Build Project** (or the green arrow ▶️).

### How to add your own files:
- Place all `.c` files into the `src/` folder and Place all `.h` files into the `include/` folder, if you have that.
- IDE will automatically pick them up!
